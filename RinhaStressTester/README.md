# Rinha Stress Tester

A comprehensive .NET 9 load testing tool for the Rinha de Backend 2025 challenge with advanced features including **mid-test delay simulation**.

## üî• New Features

### Random Stress Condition System
The stress tester uses a **dice roll system** to randomly apply stress conditions during tests:

- **1d4 Roll** determines which stress condition to apply
- **25% chance each** for: Both delay+failure, Failure only, Delay only, or No stress
- **Can be disabled** with `--no-stress` flag for guaranteed clean tests
- **Applied at random points** during the test (between 10% and 90% completion)

### Stress Conditions Applied
When stress is triggered, it can include:

- **High Latency**: Sets 1250ms delay on default processor
- **Failures**: Enables failures on default processor  
- **Random Timing**: Applied at 1-3 random points during test execution
- **Automatic Reset**: All conditions are reset after test completion

This simulates real-world unpredictable scenarios during peak load!

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Basic stress test with random stress conditions (1d4 roll system)
dotnet run -- -r 1000 -t 20

# Clean test with NO stress conditions (guaranteed)
dotnet run -- -r 1000 -t 20 --no-stress

# Higher load test with random conditions
dotnet run -- -r 5000 -t 50 --url http://localhost:9999

# Manually set processor delay (utility mode - no stress test)
dotnet run -- --set-delay 1250 --processor default
dotnet run -- --set-delay 500 --processor fallback
dotnet run -- --set-delay 0 --processor default  # Reset delay
```

### Command Line Options

| Option | Short | Description | Default |
|--------|-------|-------------|---------|
| `--requests` | `-r` | Number of requests to send (required for stress test) | - |
| `--threads` | `-t` | Number of concurrent threads | 10 |
| `--url` | `-u` | Base URL for the API | http://localhost:9999 |
| `--set-delay` | - | Set delay on processor in milliseconds (utility mode) | - |
| `--processor` | - | Processor type: default or fallback | default |
| `--no-stress` | - | Disable random stress conditions (force clean test) | false |
| `--help` | `-h` | Show help message | - |

**Note**: By default, stress conditions are applied randomly via 1d4 dice roll. Use `--no-stress` to guarantee no stress conditions.

## Demo Scripts

Since stress conditions are now random, demo scripts would show different stress patterns:

1. **`basic-test.bat`** - Basic stress test with random conditions
2. **`high-load-test.bat`** - High load test with random conditions  
3. **`utility-delay-test.bat`** - Manual delay setting utilities
4. **`clean-test.bat`** - Reset all delays before testing

## How Random Stress Works

### Dice Roll System
1. At test start, rolls **1d4** to determine stress condition:
   - **Roll 1**: Both high latency (1250ms) and failures
   - **Roll 2**: Failures only
   - **Roll 3**: High latency (1250ms) only  
   - **Roll 4**: No stress conditions

### Random Application Points
2. If stress is enabled, it applies at **1-3 random request indices**:
   - Applied between 10% and 90% of total requests
   - Multiple stress points possible in one test
   - Each application point shows in logs

3. **Automatic cleanup** resets all conditions after test completion

This simulates real-world scenarios like:
- Unpredictable database slowdowns during peak traffic
- Random network latency spikes
- Sudden resource constraints
- External service degradations
- **Random processor failures and recovery**
- **Unexpected service circuit breaker activation**
- **Real-world chaos engineering scenarios**

## Processor URLs

The tool targets these processor endpoints:
- **Default Processor**: `http://localhost:8001`
- **Fallback Processor**: `http://localhost:8002`
- **Main API**: `http://localhost:9999` (default)

## Building and Running

### Build the project:
```bash
dotnet build
```

### Run the stress tester:
```bash
dotnet run -- [options]
```

### Run from published executable:
```bash
dotnet publish -c Release
./bin/Release/net9.0/RinhaStressTester.exe [options]
```

## Notes

- The stress tester generates realistic payment data with random amounts between R$ 0.01 and R$ 1,000.00
- Each request includes a unique correlation ID
- Progress updates are shown every 100 requests
- All requests are made concurrently within the specified thread limit
- Mid-test delay change requires the default processor to be running on `http://localhost:8001`
- Mid-test failure simulation requires the default processor to be running on `http://localhost:8001`
- Uses separate HttpClient instances to avoid interference between stress test and configuration calls
